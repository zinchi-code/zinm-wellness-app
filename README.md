🌿 **ZIN WELLNESS APP**


🧘🏽‍♀️ _**About the Project**_


Zin Wellness App is a calming wellness platform designed to help users moisturise, meditate, practise mindfulness, stay organised, and nurture a positive mindset, all in one place. Inspired by real life challenges like busy schedules and my ADHD (forgetfulness), it’s built to support self-care in a simple, intentional way.
